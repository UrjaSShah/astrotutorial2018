## Administrative things

0. useful [computer science classes](https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/courses/computer_and_information_science_and_engineering/) and some thoughts on why they'd be beneficial:
    - [COP 2271: Computer Programming for Engineers](https://catalog.ufl.edu/search/?search=COP+2271): A programming course with a more practical approach and emphasis on science/engineering applications.
    - [COP 3502: Programming Fundamentals](https://catalog.ufl.edu/search/?P=COP%203502) and [COP 3503: Programming Fundamentals 2](https://catalog.ufl.edu/search/?P=COP%203503): These teach the basics of computer programming. Some of this will overlap with what we're doing on our own, but other aspects of it will be new.
    - [COP 3530: Data Structures and Algorithm](https://catalog.ufl.edu/search/?P=COP%203530): I mostly listed this course because it's a pre-requisite for CAP 4770. The data structures information may not be something that would be used in day-to-day astronomy research, unless you go into a data-intensive research area.
    - [COT 4501: Numerical Analysis: a Computational Approach](https://catalog.ufl.edu/search/?P=COT%204501): This course would be good for learning about how to use computer programs to solve (astro)physics problems when it's not possible or straight-forward to solve them analytically. This course likely duplicates a lot of functionality from AST 4930 ("Computational Astrophysics"), so I would instead recommend the AST course if you have the choice. I believe AST 4930 will be offered again in Fall 2019 (it's an every other year course). I'm told there will be a similar class taught in the physics department in Fall 2018, but I couldn't find the number.
    - [CAP 4770: Introduction to Data Science](https://catalog.ufl.edu/search/?P=CAP%204770): This would be a good course, particularly because astronomy is becoming a much more data-intensive field. We now have large surveys with hundreds of millions or even a billion objects. And this will continues to grow. So knowing how to handle and analyze these types of large datasets will be helpful.
