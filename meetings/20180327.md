## Administrative things

0. 

## Papers

1. [arXiv/astro-ph](http://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/new)

## Python

1. Go over ball size script and modifications.

### For Next Week

Starting from [20180327/sphere.py][20180327/sphere.py], add code to:

1. compute the volume of a sphere with the input radius
2. compute the surface area of a sphere with the input radius
3. Write both these out to the screen

#### Bonus Items

If you finish the above items, try these:

4. Put the calculations of the volume and the surface area into their own, individual functions and then call those functions in the main script. (Hint: see the `def` keyword. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)
5. Right now, the program asks the user to type in a radius for the sphere. Try to modify the program to take arguments from the command line. So that you can instead do: `python sphere.py R` where `R` is the radius. (Hint: see `sys.argv` in the `sys` library: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv).
