## Python

### Take-home activity

See [this python program](20180320/sport_balls.py).
It asks the user to enter the diameter of a ball and then it writes out what type of ball it is.
Run the program a few times and see how it works.

Then do the following:

1. What happens if you type in letters instead of a number for the diameter? Can you test for this to prevent the program from crashing? (Hint: think of using `type()`, `if` / `else` statements, and a `while` loop.)

2. Modify the program to compute the surface area and volume of the ball, then write that information out to the screen. Make these as new functions.

3. How would you have to change the program to handle a rugby ball or another ball that is not round?
