## Administrative things

0. No meetings for the next month or so. We will resume the week of 21 May, but can keep working remotely and stay in touch via slack.

## Science

Look at the processed images made during the previous week.

## Python

1. loading and displaying images
2. `for` loops

### To work on at home

- Try to combine (by averaging) all the bias frames from the FITS files into a master bias frame. Save the result into a file using `np.save()`
- Also, display the resulting bias image inside the jupyter notebook and try to export the notebook as a PDF and post that to slack. Experiment with the data scaling and the min/max range of `imshow()` to display the range of the data without saturating.

#### Bonus items
- Using `np.save()` loses all the metadata in the FITS header. Can you think of a way to use the output of `fits.open()` as a container to save a new master bias? Hint: think about the `.data` component - what variable type is it?
- Try to make a master dark using a similar process. Remember for this we only want the dark current and not the bias + dark current.
