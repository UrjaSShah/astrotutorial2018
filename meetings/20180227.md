## Python

We will do python first this week since we didn't get to it at all last week.

* "Hello world"
* simple arithmetic
* variable types (int, float, string, tuple, list, dictionary)
* flow/control statements
* functions
* scripting, interactive sessions, notebooks

## Papers

We will continue going through Sanders & Mirabel.

* [Sanders & Mirabel 1996](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1996ARA&A..34..749S/abstract): A review article on the properties of galaxies whose total energy output is dominated by infrared emission. While now 20+ years old, the basic picture is still in place and this provides a lot of good background.
