[header comparison loop notebook](20180723-Header_comparison_loop.ipynb)

### For next time

- install `git` through anaconda
- see if all of the flat frames are the same exposure time. If they are not, create new master flats, one for each exposure length
- create a normalized master flat (i.e., take the master flat you have and normalize it by the mean or median of itself)
